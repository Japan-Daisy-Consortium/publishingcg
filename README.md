# Publishing Community Group

This is the repository for ongoing work done by the [W3C Publishing Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/).

The Community Group was formed to recommend the best way to synchronize audio or video with Web Publications and other document formats being developed by the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/), in order to make the publications accessible to people with different types of reading requirements.

Chairs of the group are [Jeff Xu, Rakuten, Inc.](mailto:zheng.xu@rakuten.com) and [Matus Teixeira, W.W. Norton & Company](mailto:mteixeira@wwnorton.com)
